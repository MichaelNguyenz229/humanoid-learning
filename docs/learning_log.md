# Learning Log

## Day 1 - [Today's Date]

### What I learned:
- Virtual environments vs project folders (they're separate!)
- PATH environment variables and why conda needs initialization
- Project structure best practices
- Integrated terminal in VSCode

### What I built:
- First MuJoCo simulation (falling sphere)
- Proper project structure with docs, experiments, models, src

### Challenges:
- conda not working in Command Prompt initially
- Fixed with `conda init cmd.exe`

### Next steps:
- Load actual humanoid model
- Understand the physics simulation loop
- Make the humanoid stand up

### Questions for later:
- How does reinforcement learning work with MuJoCo?
- What's the difference between Unitree H1 and Optimus?
